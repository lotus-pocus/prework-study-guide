# <Prework-Study-Guide Webpage>

## Description

The motivation was to learn and understand web development. I built this project to allow me to organize my study notes in a structured and clear way which helps me to find the notes I need quickly. I have learnt the importance of being methodical with my coding as well as understanding the processes involved in creating a webpage.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. If we open the Dev Tools console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or ctrl+shift+I (Windows), we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
